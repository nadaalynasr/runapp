For security and password storage, we used the same approach as Project 2. 
To store the passwords in the database, we used bcrpyt to hash them first. 
The functionality for this was provided during SpringBoot setup. 
User passwords are encoded with passwordEncoder.encode(password) in UserService before being added to the database.
