Groups Page: I implemented the Groups Page, which shows two sections: the groups a user is already part of and the groups they can join. To build this page, I added the logic to load the user’s current groups, display all other available groups, and update the member count when someone joins or leaves. I also connected these actions to the buttons on each group card so the page responds immediately to user interaction. On the UI side, I implemented a reusable group card component to keep the layout consistent, making sure each group displays its name, member information, and next run details.

Trending Page: I created the UI and layout for the Trending Page, setting up its structure and design. I reused the Groups Page Mustache components so the layout follows a similar format and keeps the app’s design consistent.

Log A Run Page: I implemented the Log A Run page that allows users to save their runs into their account. Each new run entry contains the duration of the run, the distance, and BPM. We assume the time of entry as the ending time, and calculate the start time ourselves. We also save the run's title in a similar way to Strava, where no title entered then defaults to a time-based default title. I implemented the UI for this page in a way that could be reused for the Create Group page.
