Log A Run Page: I implemented the Log A Run page that allows users to save their runs into their account. Each new run entry contains the duration of the run, the distance, and BPM. We assume the time of entry as the ending time, and calculate the start time ourselves. We also save the run's title in a similar way to Strava, where no title entered then defaults to a time-based default title. I implemented the UI for this page in a way that could be reused for the Create Group page.
